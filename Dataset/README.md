# Brain Tumor Segmentation using the BraTS Dataset

## Objectives:

- *Data Scientist*: Exploring the publicly available brain tumor data and deep learning models that generalize well for tumor segmentation. Focusing on the development of a deep learning model for the segmentation of brain tumors using the BraTS dataset to support clinical decision making.
- *Data Engineer*: To analyse the dataset received from data scientist
- *Machine Learning Engineer*: To develop a segmentation model which generalizes well on unseen data.
- *Backed Engineer*: Creating a WebApp, Integrating the ML model with front end application. Deploy the application on AWS (Resources dependent). Creating an entire backend ecosystem to use the WebApp.
