# BraTS Dataset

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model for the segmentation of brain tumors, using the BraTS dataset.

## Dataset Description
The BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation) dataset is a comprehensive collection of multi-parametric MRI scans, including T1, T1Gd, T2, and FLAIR sequences. It provides manually annotated segmentations of tumor sub-regions, facilitating the development and evaluation of segmentation algorithms. The 2024 BraTS challenge introduces new sub-challenges, such as post-treatment glioma segmentation.
